## Playbook steps explained

### When Microsoft Sentinel incident creation rule is triggered

Microsoft Sentinel incident is created. The playbook receives the incident as the input.

### Entities - Get Hosts

Get the list of risky devices as entities from the Incident

### Initialize variable to assign the Organization Id

Initialize an string variable to assign the Organization Id provided by Client while deploying the playbook and used a parameter while calling the search devices with organization API action.

### Initialize variable to assign the Carbon Black devices information

Initialize an array variable to assign the Carbon Black devices used as source to format the HTML with the devices information

### Initialize variable to assign the quarantined devices information

Initialize an array variable to assign the quarantined devices information used as source to format the HTML with the action takened devices information

### For each-hosts

This action will perform the following actions:

  a. Make a call to Carbon Black API with the parameters [ Contains device name ]
  b. Verify the Carbon Black returned the results and Check the device is quarantined
  c. If the device is not quarantined then isolate it.

### Construct HTML table - Carbon Black devices information

This action will construct the HTML table with devices information

### Construct HTML table - Quarantined devices through playbook

This action will construct the HTML table with Quarantined devices through playbook

### Add a comment to the incident with the information

This action will enrich the incident with the constructed HTML table with devices information

### Close the comment

This action will close the incident if there is no exceptions occurred while quarantining the devices
