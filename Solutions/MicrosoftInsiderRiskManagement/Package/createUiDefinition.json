This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)._\n\n**Note:** _There may be [known issues](https://aka.ms/sentinelsolutionsknownissues) pertaining to this Solution, please refer to them before installing._\n\nThe Azure Sentinel: Insider Risk Management Solution (https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/InsiderRiskManagement/readme.md) demonstrates the “better together” story between Microsoft 365 Insider Risk Management and Azure Sentinel. This workbook integrates telemetry from 25+ Microsoft security products to provide actionable insights into insider risk management. Reporting tools provide “Go to Alert” links to provide deeper integration between products and a simplified user experience for exploring alerts. A filter set provides custom reporting for Guide, Subscription, Workspace, and Time. The workbook can be exported as a PDF or print report via the Print Workbooks feature. Content sections include Overviews, Insider Risk Management, Watchlist, and User Forensics. The Overview tab provides recommendations for building insider risk program architectures. The Insider Risk tab provides alert reporting by both insider risk scenarios such as Sensitive Data Leaks, Security Violations, and MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The Watchlist tab provides filtering by Azure Sentinel Watchlists and the User Forensics tab collects logging telemetry by user. The user experience includes designing insider risk management architectures and streamlining telemetry from all users > watchlist > specific users while transitioning to M365 Insider Risk Management to investigate/resolve activity of interest.\n\nAzure Sentinel Solutions provide a consolidated way to acquire Azure Sentinel content like data connectors, workbooks, analytics, and automations in your workspace with a single deployment step.\n\n**Workbooks:** 1, **Analytic Rules:** 5, **Hunting Queries:** 5\n\n[Learn more about Azure Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
